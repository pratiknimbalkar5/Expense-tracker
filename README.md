Expense Tracker

A simple and user-friendly Expense Tracker built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helps users add, view, and manage their daily expenses directly in the browser. All data is stored using the Local Storage API, ensuring the expenses remain saved even after the page is refreshed or reopened.

📘 How It Works

When a user adds an expense, JavaScript stores it as an object in the browser’s localStorage.
Whenever the page loads, the app reads all saved entries and displays them in the list.
Users can also delete items, and the changes update instantly both on the screen and in storage.
